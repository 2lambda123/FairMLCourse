**April 4, 1810:**

Someone brought up the perennial R-vs.-PYthon-for-data-science issue in class today. I made a comment about random forests, which I will elaborate on below, but first I should make one point clear: Our course is not an R-in-fair-learning class; it's a fair-learning class, period. The emphasis is on the concepts and algorithms, not on the languge.

At any rate, I mentioned that IMO there are better libraries for random forests in R than in Python. In case anyone is curious, I would cite e.g. the [grf package](https://github.com/grf-labs/grf) by the Stanford Econ and Stat people. The linear interpolation capability is especially important. 

But again, the grf package was developed in R (I think there is now a Python version, though not in sklearn), but again not because R is a "better" language but because Stat people tend to use R.

We will use qeML ("quick and easy machine learning"), a package I developed to get people without prior background quickly into ML.

Please read the class syllabus in our course GitHub repo. Read the procedural document as soon as possible, as it is vital to your doing well in the course.

All class announcements from this point onward will be made here in this
blog, rather than by mass e-mail.  When making a blog post, I will also
try to send a message notifying you of a new post, but may not always do
so.  You are required to read the blog at least once per day.
