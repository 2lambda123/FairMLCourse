All class announcements from this point onward will be made on our class
blog,

https://github.com/ucdavis/FairMLCourse/blob/main/Blog.md

rather than by mass e-mail.  When making a blog post, I will also
try to send a message notifying you of a new post, but may not always do
so.  You are required to read the blog at least once per day.
