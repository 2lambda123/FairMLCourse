# ECS 189G Term Project

## General requirements

* Due June 11, 11:59 pm.  

* You will be analyzing a dataset of your choice (pre-approved by me),
  using tools and perspectives from our course.  You will address both
  bias detection and mitigation.
    
* There are many choices in the dataset collection on our course repo, but many   others are possible.

* A central requirement will be that there be a published paper that
  analyzes the dataset in terms of ML fairness.

* Use of fair ML algorithms other than those in our course 
  is also allowed.  R implementations only, please.

* A professional-quality written report, prepared in [LaTeX](http://heather.cs.ucdavis.edu/~matloff/latex.html ), will be required.  This means clear writing, correct grammar, informative graphics (again, R only, please),attractive presentation and so on.

* Your report will compare and contrast the results of your analyses with
  those of the published paper.  Which findings of the latter were
  confirmed?  Which of your findings seem contrary to those of the
  published work?  What avenues did you explore that were not pursued in
  that work?

* Though you'll write some supporting code, *this is not a coding
  project*.  It is *analysis*, with an emphasis on interpretation.

## Details regarding your report and its submission

* Make sure the human grader (me) is in good mood when he grades.
  Follow directions!  Don't make the grading script crash!

* **DOUBLE-CHECK THAT YOU ARE MEETING ALL SPECS!**  Whoever does the
  actual turning in of your submission, impress upon him/her that this
  is a huge responsiblity that can affect everyone's grade. 

* Absolutely NO late reports will be accepted.  **As you near the
  deadline, keep submitting what you have** (each one will overwrite the
  last), so that at least you will get a lot of credit even if you don't
  finish. *Each team member has the responsibility of checking that this
  is being done.*

* Include a section listing each team member's contribution to the
  project -- who did what.  If a member did not participate, do not
  include him/her in this section, nor in the <b>.tar</b> file name.
  **Don't forget this section!**

* Don't skimp on time devoted to the writing.  **The phrasing matters!**
  This is true both in terms of having good, professional writing
  quality, but also in terms of *proper interpretation*, which will be
  vital in your report.

* Package your files, i.e. **.tex**, **.pdf**, **.R**, image files,
  etc., in a file whose name is of the form **email1.email2....tar**,
  where each <b>emaili</b> is the UCD e-mail address of group
  member i, e.g. <b> bclinton.gwbush.bobama.dtrump.tar</b>.  Note the
  periods separating fields.  Don't get the address wrong!  Otherwise
  the grading script may not give someone credit.

* The **.tar** file must have no subdirectories.  (See our Hwk 1 specs
  on this.)

* You must include both the **.tex** file and the **.pdf** file that it
  generates.  Your LaTeX file must be named **ProjectReport.tex**, and
  the corresponding PDF **ProjectReport.pdf**.

* Submit your report to my **handin** site on CSIF (NOT the TA's
  site), username **matloff**, directory **189gproject**.

* Groups that put in a reasonable amount of time -- and thought! --
   almost always receive an A or A+ grade on the project.  Groups that
   do not complete the project usually get a D grade.  **PLEASE START
   EARLY!**
