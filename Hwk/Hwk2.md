## Problem 1

### Goal: 

In recent years, there has been much criticism from politically-liberal
educators of the use of standardized tests as school admissions criteria.
Much of the discussion has involved the SAT (university), GRE (graduate
school) and the LSAT (law school), especially the SAT.

Critics of the SAT cite
[research](https://budgetmodel.wharton.upenn.edu/issues/2021/9/28/is-income-implicit-in-measures-of-student-ability) showing a correlation between a
student's SAT scores and her family's income.  The test measures family
wealth, not academic readiness, they say.

Defenders of the SAT cite
other research and the stellar performance of many East Asian or East
European children of 
(working-class
immigrants)[https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/03/228192/stuyvesant-high-school-black-asian-students].

Warning: the findings of various social science research studies are
often contradictory.  For instance, in the area of immigration, with
which I have familiarity, I can usually tell whether a paper is
supportive or critical of a more expansive immigration policy simply by
seeing who the author is.

Why is that?  Typically authors on both sides of a controversial issue
make the error of, in essence, investigation unconditional correlations
instead of conditional ones.  They omit important variables from their
analyses (usually unwittingly rather than intentionally).

These points will often arise in our course, but in the case of this
assignment, our role will be rather different.  We will ask, can we make
use of the SAT etc. in a way that is fair, in spite of possible
connections to family income?
